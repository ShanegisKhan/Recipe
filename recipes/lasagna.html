<h2><p>What side dishes go with lasagna?</p></h2>

<p>A simple side salad is a classic side for lasagna, as well as garlic bread.</p>

<h2><p>Is lasagna better with ricotta or cottage cheese?</p></h2>

<p>It's a personal preference! Some prefer the richness and creaminess of ricotta cheese, while others like the lower-in-fat cottage cheese option 
that is chunkier due to the curds. Try our traditional lasagna for the perfect combo of both. Be sure to check out our secret tricks to making the 
best lasagna ever.</p>

<h2><p>Why is my lasagna watery?</p></h2>

<p>To avoid watery lasagna, make sure your lasagna noodles are drained properly before layering. Once they are cooked and drained, do not rinse with 
water but immediately place in a single layer on a lightly oiled tray. Not rinsing in water will allow the sauce to cling to the starches on the noodle. 
If using cottage cheese, drain it for an hour or so before using. Simmer the sauce for at least 30 minutes uncovered to allow excess water to evaporate. 
Also, uncover the lasagna during the last 25 minutes of baking to release any extra moisture in the pan.</p>
