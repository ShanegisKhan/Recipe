<h2>HOMEMADE VANILLA ICE CREAM TIPS<h2>
<h3>How do you make homemade ice cream creamy and not icy?</h3>
<p>To ensure your homemade ice cream will come out creamy, use heavy cream, half-and-half or milk with a higher percentage milk fat, such as whole milk. 
    If the ice cream is made with a lower percentage milk fat, it has the potential to become icy.</p>
<h3>How should I store homemade ice cream?</h3>
<p>Store homemade ice cream in the freezer in an airtight container with a piece of plastic wrap or waxed paper pressed directly onto the surface.
    This will prevent ice crystals from forming.</p>
<h3>How do you make homemade ice cream thicker?</h3>
<p>Thicker ice creams usually involve the addition of eggs, egg yolks or cornstarch as stabilizers or thickeners. The ice cream "base" is basically a 
    cooked custard that, when chilled very well, spins up into a creamy, but firmer ice cream. Try our creamy vanilla ice cream, Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s vanilla ice
     cream, old-time custard ice cream or homemade frozen custard if you're aiming for ice cream with some thickness to it.</p>
<h3>How do you make ice cream without an ice cream maker?</h3>
<p>No ice cream maker, no problem! To make ice cream without an ice cream maker, pour the ice cream mixture into a shallow container (glass or metal work best) 
    that you've popped in the freezer previously to get nice and chilled. Store in the coldest part of your freezer until almost firm, but still soft enough to be 
    stirred. For the next three hours, check the ice cream every 30 minutes and stir or mix with a hand mixer to keep it aerated and creamy. You can also make ice 
    cream in a coffee can!</p>
<p><B>Editor's Note:</B> For raspberry or strawberry ice cream, substitute 2 cups fresh or frozen berries for 1 cup of half-and-half. Puree berries in a blender or 
    food processor; stir into the other ingredients before freezing.</p>
