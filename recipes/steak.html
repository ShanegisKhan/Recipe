<h2>CAST-IRON SKILLET STEAK TIPS</h2>
<h3>Can you cook steak in butter?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can cook steak in butter. Baste your steak with melted butter and herbs or use a compound butter as a topper once cooked on the stove. 
    The butter will melt into the steak, giving it even more flavor. You can also try any of these steak flavor boosters!</p>
<h3>How can I make my steak juicy and tender?</h3>
<p>For the juiciest and most tender steaks, pick out a steak with a healthy amount of marbling. It may be more expensive, but the tenderness and 
    juiciness will be well worth it. Here are other helpful tips for delicious steaks.</p>
<h3>Can I cook steak in a nonstick pan?</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a cast-iron skillet, you can use a nonstick pan. To cook steak on a nonstick pan, get the pan nice and hot first. Place the 
    steak on the hot pan and don't touch it until you flip it to the other side. Once the meat is seared, turn down the temperature for medium or 
    well-done steaks. You can also finish the steak in a 350° oven.</p>
